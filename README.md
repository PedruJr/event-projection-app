# EventProjectionApp

EventProjectionApp is a modern Angular application focused on event forecasting, using Angular 19+ with the latest best practices.

---

## ðŸ“š Tech Stack

- **Angular 19 (Standalone Components + Signals)**
- **Angular Material** (UI components library)
- **ECharts** (Graph library for event projection charts)
- **Atomic Design Architecture** (Organisms / Pages)
- **State Management with Signals**
- **Clean Code, SOLID, KISS principles**
- **State-driven navigation (`showSplash`) instead of Router**

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

**Install Dependencies:**  
yarn install

**Run the Development Server:**  
yarn start

After starting the server, access the app at:  
http://localhost:4200

## âš¡ Features

- **SplashScreen Control:** Splash appears on startup and disappears after 3 seconds automatically.
- **State Management with Signals:** Entire cycles and event projections are managed reactively.
- **Clean Architecture:** UI separated from services and business logic.
- **Graphs with ECharts:** Fully customized stacked bar charts.

---

## ðŸ“œ Technical Decisions

- **Angular Material** was chosen for UI consistency, simplicity, and ease of theme adaptation.
- **ECharts** was chosen for its flexibility, performance, and capability to render complex stacked bar charts with minimal overhead.
- **SplashScreen** implemented using a `showSplash` boolean state, avoiding router complexity.
- **CSS Optimization:** Due to a visual library change during development (Material Template to direct ECharts integration), global SCSS utilities were introduced incrementally, ensuring visual consistency without breaking existing layouts.
- **Future Improvements:** Full migration to SCSS utility classes across all components to increase maintainability and scalability.
